            The Mist Bot is a Discord bot made by me (R2D2Vader) and my open source contributors, primarily for a specific set of Discord servers. <br />
            You may view the source code and / or contribute to the project at <a href="https://github.com/The-Mist-Development/The-Mist-Bot">https://github.com/The-Mist-Development/The-Mist-Bot</a>.

            You may add the bot to your server and / or use all of the provided features. <br />
            These features are subject to change and could break or be removed at a later date.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must not exploit the bot to break server rules, or the Discord Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. <br />
            If you have added the bot to your server, you must not hold me or my contributors liable for any issues in the bot exploited by users. <br />
            Please report any bugs or exploitable issues you encounter by contacting @r2d2vader on Discord.
