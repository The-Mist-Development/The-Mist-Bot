        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>7th January 2025</p>
        <p>
            When you use The Mist Bot, it collects the data necessary for certain features to work. This will change over time and as such, this privacy policy is subject to change.
        </p>
        <p>
            All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. Only the bot itself and I (R2D2Vader) have direct access to this data. <br />
            You can view the database schema in the source code. It is contained in the file <a href="https://github.com/The-Mist-Development/The-Mist-Bot/blob/master/bot/database.js">/bot/database.js</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We share some of your personal information with Steam and playerdb.co to retrieve the necessary information for the Steam Wishlist Notifications feature to work. <br /> Full details below.
